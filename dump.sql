The choice is yours.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Discover a Mysterious &amp; Dynamic World</b><br>\nDelve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. \n<br><br>\nFight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions</b><br>\nThe dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. \n<br><br>\nSize also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Dungeon Maker</b><br>\nIn Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play and share with friends with the snap of a finger using the in-game Dungeon Maker! From the room layout, monster composition and treasure the party will find – down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing – everything is decided by you.\n<br><br>\nNote that the Dungeon Maker is a work in progress and will keep being improved as time goes by, so look forward to more Dungeon Maker features in the future!</li></ul><h4>Solasta Free Content Update with the release of Primal Calling</h4><b>To celebrate the release of the Primal Calling DLC, we're releasing a free content update for all our players</b> - including a much anticipated higher level cap!\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Level cap increased from level 10 to level 12, unlocking new class features as well as level 6 spells\n<br></li><li>Scars and Facial Paints customization options in character creation\n<br></li><li>Tired of playing through the tutorial?

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrie	<a href="https://www.gog.com/promo/2023_gog_15th_anniversary"><img src="https://items.gog.com/promobanners/2023_gog_15th_anniversary.png"></a><br><hr><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_x4_store_banner_01.png"><br><br><b>Freedom to personally fly all ships:</b><br><br>\nX4 will allow you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view.\n<br><br>\nA big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_gif_fight.gif"><br><br><b>Modular stations and ship upgrades:</b><br><br>\nBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations.\n<br><br>\nShips also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_gif_docking.gif"><br><br><b>Most dynamic X universe ever:</b><br><br>\nX4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_x4_store_banner_02.png"><br><b>Managing your empire with a powerful map:</b><br><br>\nOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands.\n<br><br>\nGraphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.\n<br><br><br><b>Most detailed X economy ever:</b><br><br>\nOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.\n<br><br><br><b>Research and Teleportation:</b><br><br>\nThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.\n<br><br>\nEvery order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.\n<br><br><br><b>Get into the game:</b><br><br>\nIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.\n\n<br><br><p class="module">\nRegister your copy of X4: Foundations and X4: Foundations Collector's Edition to receive access to additional Online Ventures and rewards.

Deceptively easy at a first glance, it offers lots of possibilities:\n<ul><li>Units have front/side/back/top armor and their positioning matters a lot</li><li>Fences and other obstacles offer a directional cover that depends on the angle of attack</li><li>Different terrain types offer various bonuses and affect Line of Sight</li><li>Destroyed vehicles and other large objects affect the battlefield and provide cover</li><li>High Ground mechanics allow multiple levels of terrain elevation that affect Line of Sight and combat effectiveness</li><li>Destructible buildings with different stages of demolition create unique challenges</li></ul><br><b>Enjoy the striking visuals</b><br>\nAll units and scenery are created with the finest attention to detail using Unreal Engine 4 to achieve a very realistic visual style:\n<ul><li>Realistic unit models with proper physics in place</li><li>Visceral elements of devastation - burning tank hulks, ruined houses, shell craters, smoke, death, and destruction. You will witness this and many other horrors of the war</li><li>Varied surroundings - your troops will come across war-torn battlefields as well as peaceful villages with cattle and fields of grain. Mind your tanks - this quaint beauty is quite fragile</li></ul><br><b>Go through numerous battles</b><br>\nSee all sides of the story by completing 3 campaigns with 9 operations in each. <br>\nThe game features United States, United Kingdom, and German campaigns all set in the Normandy landings period of the war.<br><br><b>Manage your troops</b><br>\nBetween the battles, you can upgrade or change your units, level them up, and assign heroes to them, granting unique abilities<br><br><b>Keep your crews safe</b><br>\nEvery unit has a crew - and the crew is the heart of any unit. Losing different crew members results in different penalties for the unit. Losing a gunner means the unit has fewer attacks, losing a driver means the unit has reduced mobility, and so on. <br><br><b>Be victorious in any skirmish</b><br>\nTest your skills against an AI on each of the 6 skirmish maps.

In the 12th century, a supernatural catastrophe tore the fabric of reality, unleashing spirits and magic, forever changing medieval Earth. Cast into this world and besieged by spirits and power groups, you must gain allies, take up arms and find your destiny.\n<br><br>\nTo the common folk, magic was something to be feared and undoubtedly the handiwork of evil demons. People across Europe sought protection from the forces of evil and therefore relinquished utter control of their lives to the Inquisition.\n<br><br>\nTo this day, the Inquisition still governs most of civilized Europe, directly or indirectly. In their relentless hunt for heretical wizards and magical creatures the Inquisition inspires awe and faith among many, and is despised and feared by others.\n<br><br>\nChoose your champion – Feralkin, Sylvant, Demonkin, or Human Pureblood – and align yourself with the Knights Templar, the Inquisition, or the Wielders.

No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br><br><b>SUPERHOT’s features:</b><br>\n&nbsp;\n<ul><li>Endless Mode : how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?</li></ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul><li>Challenge Mode: take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.</li></ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul><li>Replay Editor: edit and upload your best runs for all to see on killterest.com.</li></ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul><li>Extras: delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].</li></ul><br>\nThirty months in the making.

A hail of slow-motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they’re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br><br>\nEverything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel.<br><br>\nYou take a moment to consider. You’ve been here before.

TriOptimum Corporation	<a href="https://www.gog.com/promo/2023_gog_15th_anniversary"><img src="https://items.gog.com/promobanners/2023_gog_15th_anniversary.png"></a><br><hr><br><i>TriOptimum wishes you a safe journey aboard the Von Braun, the first craft in the history of mankind capable of faster-than-light travel. TriOptimum Corporation: we give you the stars!</i><br><br>\nThe second--and best!--game in the series stands all on its own as a masterpiece of gaming history. The starship Von Braun took a giant leap for mankind as it made its first interstellar journey. The mission was going as planned until a lone distress call from the Tau Ceti V sector was picked up. An away team was sent on a rescue mission, but once it arrived at its destination, there was no sign of any humans and the source of the signal remained unclear. They didn't realize something crucial, though: they brought something back with them when they returned. Now, you--a member of the ship's security team--awake from cryostasis to the sounds of screams of pain and horror as everything falls apart. The state-of-the-art spaceship becomes a deathtrap, and the only hope you have is the contemptuous whisper of a voice guiding you through the dark corridors, leading you towards the ominous secrets that lurk in the shadows.\n<br><br>\nA game like this is a masterpiece; you must experience it firsthand. System Shock™ 2 arguably offers the most intense storytelling in the history of computer games. It perfectly splices Sci-Fi with survival horror, FPS gameplay with character stats, upgrades, and inventory system of the role-playing genre, fast paced action with chilling terror. As you slowly and carefully explore your surroundings, the game begins to swallow you whole, and soon enough you feel completely immersed in the terrifying reality of an interstellar ghost-ship. Then, even years after your first contact with the game, just hearing the words "System Shock™ 2" will make your heart race. This is going to be a hell of a journey, for a pathetic creature of meat and bone such as yourself.\n<br><br>\nCheck out our <b><a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/mod_spotlight_system_shock_2">Mod Spotlight for System Shock 2!</a></b><br><br>\n-<i>"10 out of 10"</i> - Computer Games Magazine<br>\n-<i>"An advanced, progressive spin on first-person gaming"</i> - Edge Online<br>\n-<i>"One of the 100 best games of all time"</i> - Empire Online<br>\n-<i>"95%"</i> - PC Gamer<br>\n-<i>"Greatest Games of all Times"</i> list - Gamespot<br>\n-<i>"Top 50 Greatest Games of All Time"</i> list - Gamespy<br><br><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">The most requested game on the <a href="http://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/system_shock_2" class="vdark_un">GOG.com wishlist</a> has arrived at last!</li><li class="description__features-point">Three character profiles to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses: the psionic power-wielding agent, the naval officer--a masterful hacker, and the marine, a combat specialist.</li><li class="description__features-point">You don't have to face the horror alone.

A native blossom is the last hope for humanity after a virus brought back from Mars triggered a zombie apocalypse.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_fury/DEAD_FURY_INTENSE_GUN_FIGHT_ZOMBIES_.png"><br><br>\nOur hero Jaxon is infected, relying on short-term antidote doses by working for Daylin Hyst, the volatile gang leader of the Highway Raiders.\n<br>\nDoc, an engineer in the camp, assists Jaxon with the daily tasks of cultivating the crops the gang trades with the military - a lucky deal negotiated by way of Doc's brother, a sergeant in the force...\n<br><br>\nBut when Daylin mercilessly kills Doc's brother, and the hordes begin to overwhelm their operations, Jaxon realizes he's caught in the middle of an all-out war.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_fury/DEAD_FURY_THIRD_PERSON_ZOMBIE_HORDE_SHOOTER_NEW_.png"><br><br><b>A Deadly Passenger...</b><br>\nOn its return journey to Earth from Mars, a probe analyzing samples of potential life identifies a significant biological hazard and alerts mission control. The lead scientist for the mission recommends aborting via self-destructing the probe, but the corporation funding the mission overruled this and instead voted to continue, concerned about the financial loss. \n<br><br>\nThe lead scientist fought to overturn this but could not, and in the final moments before landing back on Earth, he self-destructed the probe on its final approach. Unfortunately, the robust virus (Panspermia) quickly spread around the globe, carried by water vapor high in the earth's atmosphere, eventually infecting all mankind. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_fury/DEAD_FURY_RADIAL_MENU_ACTION_ADVENTURE_SHOOTER.png"><br><br>\nThe Jezaro Virus, more commonly referred to as "Dead Fury" renders the infected initially delirious, eventually becoming violent and zombie-like. Some survivors believe a level of consciousness remains deep inside the victim, though most are more worried about surviving the huge hordes the Dead Fury form.\n<br><br>\nThe game begins 12 months after this apocalyptic event. The world is overrun by the infected and our protagonist Jaxon is both a slave to the virus and the gangs who hold the cure. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_fury/DEAD_FURY_NEW_ZOMBIE_GAMES_NEW_ZEALAND.png"><br><br><b>Two Game Modes </b><br>\nStory Mode: Takes the player on a linear narrative-driven journey, following the protagonist Jaxon as he struggles to survive the chaos that his gang camp leader Daylin unleashes on a daily basis. \n<br>\nHorde Mode: Positions the player in an all-out survival arcade mode battle.

Building a city on the back of a sentient creature comes with its own set of challenges, but as you build your relationship and travel across the galaxy, you'll come across great opportunities for exploration and stable expansion. Meet other species, pursue the needs and wants of your Peeps, and seek the truth about their ancestors, and the Space Whales alike.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_01.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_01.png"><br><br>\nThe Peeps have managed to establish a fledgling settlement on Kewa's back. Now you must grow your civilisation and relationship with Kewa if you are to survive the challenges of the greater universe, navigating the limited space and resources available on Kewa as best as possible. Will you establish massive industries at the expense of your relationship with Kewa, or use Kewa primarily as a home, gathering resources at your settlements when possible instead? Watch out for pollution that upsets Peeps and Kewa alike, and consider approaching city-building in a sustainable way to maintain the happiness of the Peeps without destroying their future. Learn to harness the benefits of each season as Kewa travels closer to and further away from suns, but be wary of seasonal dangers to your survival, and the vagaries of Kewa's desires.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_02.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_02.png"><br><br>\nKewa is an intelligent and ancient being, traveling as they please across the randomly generated universe. The Peeps must first build a relationship with Kewa if they wish to influence their travels. Will your decisions be at the cost of Kewa's happiness, ensuring the Peeps are taken care of above all, or will you care for Kewa as well, limiting your exploitation, and potentially upsetting the Peeps as their demands aren't met as often? As the bond grows, you will journey across the galaxy and establish small settlements on planets to access new resources, coordinating the movement of goods from them to Kewa and back. Deciding where to go and who to engage with will determine how the Peeps progress - will you prioritise industrialisation, cultural prosperity, or both hand-in-hand? Besides planets and asteroids, alien races will have mysteries of their own, presenting new opportunities and advancements to your Peeps.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_03.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_03.png"><br><br>\nThough Beyond These Stars is primarily a city-builder, asking you to manage the puzzle of limited space, having you juggle access to one resource at the cost of another, or giving you advantages when using specific layouts, your settlements aren't the only things you'll be building. The relationship between the Peeps and Kewa is a crucial aspect of your survivability, and to that end, you'll be concerned with keeping Kewa happy while keeping the Peeps alive. Your approach to sustainability and pollution will further influence how others feel about your Peeps - they all have something to offer, but only to those they like. From additional objectives and their subsequent rewards to new technologies and the doors they open, your progress is determined by the way you treat the world around you. Will you focus on being self-sufficient at the cost of sustainability, or will you prioritise these relationships with others at the cost of your civilisations efficiency and happiness? Success in Beyond These Stars is not simply a matter of exploitation and organisation, but instead, it is a matter of the relationships you nurture, and the symbiotic relationship between your Peeps and the universe around them.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_04.png">	485.79	1969-12-31	BR0	198	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:15.131-03	2023-09-29 19:11:15.224-03

A popular gaming style in the late 1980’s, Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen.<h4>Gameplay</h4>The main goal is conquering the bigger portion of the screen. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield depletes. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well.\n<br>\nThere are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and the required conquered area percentage for the victory.<h4>Key Features</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 8 unlucky girls in need of help\n<br></li><li> 32 levels with unique bosses and minions\n<br></li><li> Absurd stories that will reveal details about the bosses and the girls \n<br></li><li><b>Fully animated, Japanese and English voice overs for all the characters! </b><br></li><li> Lovely graphics!\n<br></li><li> Traps, towers, crates and bonus effects\n<br></li><li> Arcade Mode\n<br></li><li> Live high scores displayed for hardcore players\n<br></li><li> Nostalgia remastered!</li></ul><h4>Stories</h4><b>Have you ever asked these questions to yourself:</b><br>\nHow do you stop a heartless but not soulless emperor?\n<br>\nCan someone be a gyroscope and a guard dog at the same time?\n<br>\nWhy do those ducks attack us?\n<br>\nAre there really demonic headphones in the world?\n<br>\nWhy do lizardmen need a plastic toy for summoning their god?\n<br>\nHow do you become a villain after revolting against the ant queen?\n<br>\nWhat do scientists want from Albert the wonderful sea creature?\n<br><br>\nWell, Mokoko X answers all these questions and more!\n<br><br><b>Here are some missions!</b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Help out Iren with her arachnophobia and fight with the imaginary spider Mr. Fyodorov.\n<br></li><li> Protect Issa's house from getting pillaged by the ghost pirates stuck inside the anchors.

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. <b>Neverwinter Nights 2</b> is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in <b>Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer</b>. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n<br><br><b>Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir</b> gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in <b>Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate</b>.\n<br><br><b>Neverwinter Nights 2: Complete</b> is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father's post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr's social order and foil its mission.\n<br><br>\nBetween Horizons is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process – all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/between_horizons/mp4/between-horizons-gif-show-evidence.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><h4>Key Features of Between Horizons:</h4><ul><li><b>A New Kind Of Experience:</b> Between Horizons merges investigative-style gameplay with a branching sci-fi story in an ever-expanding Metroidvania-style environment.</li><li><b>Solving cases for yourself:</b> The flexible evidence system lets players assign clues to cases, confront ship denizens about them, and submit any case with evidence players have connected to it. Everything found on the ship is connected, but figuring out how — that’s the challenge.</li><li><b>At What Cost?:</b> Underneath the game's exciting and plausible sci-fi plot lies a number of thought-provoking problems inviting players to weigh intergenerational responsibility against personal freedom.</li><li><b>Getting New Perspective:</b> Timeless pixel art mixed with 3D environments and compelling visual effects come together in Between Horizons, creating a unique, beautiful art style.</li><li><b>Failure is Very Much an Option:</b> There are no second chances — submitting wrong solutions means the story will go on and players live with the consequences. A new and improved auto-save system will make sure there is no going back, as the story branches and endings are based on player decisions, none of which can be taken back.</li></ul><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/between_horizons/mp4/between-horizons-gif-walk.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright DigiTales Interactive GmbH 2022 - all rights reserved!\n        </p>	27.90	2023-12-30	BR0	193	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:06.724-03	2023-09-29 19:11:06.797-03

But the dream remained just a dream while Clawville slowly became the darkest corner of all the Wilderness.<br><br>\nChicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir classics, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor...<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/chicken_police/world.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><h4>QUOTES ABOUT US</h4><img src="https://items.gog.com/chicken_police/dest_kep_cikk.jpg"><br><br><b>FORBES:</b><i>"It's also clear from the trailer that its dark story will be pretty funny, with plenty of scope to establish it as one of the more unique releases in its genre. Needless to say, there'll be absolutely nothing like it released during 2020, and hopefully, it'll be as brilliant as it is different."</i><br><br><b>DESCTRUCTOID:</b><i>"I know I mostly cover animal-based games, but few have ever stopped me dead in my tracks like this one. I mean, did you hear that song in the trailer? That's original music, baby! I'm a sucker for games with quirky themes and original music, so of course, I took notice to this one straight away. Mix that with the animals-as-people motif and spot-on detective visuals, and yeah I didn't really stand a chance."</i><br><br><b>ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN:</b><i> "Fortunately I’m batting my jet-lagged eyes at Chicken Police, an upcoming noir detective adventure with grizzled chickens and a very good raccoon. It’s a point and clicker, which means I’ll almost certainly never play it. But I’d still like you to revel in this trailer with me. It’s a cinematographic masterpiece."</i>	39.99	2020-11-04	BR0	135	\N	\N	2023-09-29 18:56:51.58-03	2023-09-29 18:56:51.641-03

Find and hire the best staff for each respective step of the process and equip them with the right tools to optimize your business. Design your shop for the best throughput, and seek out new opportunities in the market as customers come in looking for a variety of historically inspired items – from weapons and armor to tools and cooking utensils, you’ll perfect your craft to become the Blacksmith Master. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/blacksmithGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_01.png"><br><br>\nTucked away through the winding alleys of a small medieval town lies your workshop – at first just a humble place for a humble blacksmith, but with potential for greatness. Here, you control the entire production chain - from mining the ores to smelting them into ingots, then crafting weapons, armor, tools, and jewelry to put on display and sell to customers for a profit. You will design your shop to make the best use of space, ensuring there’s enough room for the production and sale of goods alike, while adding personal touches to liven up an otherwise dreary space. As your reputation grows, so too will your operation, and it won’t be long before you become a master of your craft. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/minersGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_02.png"><br><br>\nBe it a footman’s sword, a woodsman’s axe, or an inn keeper’s frying pan, everything you produce will require raw materials dug up from the earth. Hire miners, equip them with the right tools, and ensure they have everything they need to be efficient – without them, you cannot keep your business operational. Each additional miner means additional wages that need to be paid, though overworked staff are likely to get tired and inefficient. Will you opt to provide rest stations and additional staff to keep your employees satisfied regardless of cost, or will you instead keep a handful of overworked individuals to maximize your profits? After all, mining the ore is only the first step of the process, and there are many more wages to pay. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/smelterGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_03.png"><br><br>\nThere will be many different ways to craft items in Blacksmith Master - some will require a longer process which includes heating an ingot, hammering it on an anvil, tempering it, assembling parts, and finally sharpening it on a grinding wheel.  Other items will be simpler to make, requiring less effort and time, though they might sell for a smaller profit margin as a result. \n<br>\nYour job will be to optimize your workspace as much as possible so your team of blacksmiths can work in tandem, creating goods from the simple to the highly complex, servicing customers from and around your small town. Besides weapons, shields, and armor, your crafting recipes will include other common things that medieval blacksmiths would make. This includes items like:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Kitchen utensils - spoons, forks, pots, cauldrons and everything in between.\n<br></li><li>Tools - from axes to hammers, take your pick!\n<br></li><li>Jewelry - necklaces, rings, bracelets, and crowns all fetch a handsome price.\n<br></li><li>Plus many others!</li></ul><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/grindingStoneGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_04.png"><br><br>\nDifferent blacksmiths will have different skills that you need to cultivate. Some will be great at working with metal, others will be great glassblowers, and others still might be particularly proficient with gems. Crafting items of a certain category will increase a blacksmith’s skill level, enabling them to craft more complex creations, though it might come with an added cost. Will you train them as generalists, ensuring they all have support when needed, or will you seek to train famed specialists?\n\n\n            \n    	485.79	1969-12-31	BR0	198	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:15.131-03	2023-09-29 19:11:15.224-03

The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth	\n    \n    \n    \n            This game was clearly made with passion. You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table.

Enjoy a classic RPG experience inspired by games like Baldur's Gate, Fallout 1 and 2 and Arcanum. Explore and conquer the Stolen Lands and make them your kingdom!\n<br><br>\n\nExplore the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries. Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom! To do so, you’ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_010.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br>\n\nCustomize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\n<br><br>\n\nMeet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_030.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br>\nConquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. \n<br><br>\nYour kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/pathfinder_kingmaker/gif/gif_020.gif" style="margin: 15px 0px 5px 0px; width: 600px"><br><br><h4>Explore - Conquer - Rule!</h4><br><br>\nThe Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you.

Please check back soon!\n</p><hr><br>\nMany years after the events in Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. Kain has created an empire in the world of Nosgoth where almost all humans have been exterminated. To help him maintain control over such large territory he chooses five lieutenants to command his vampire forces. Your name is Raziel and you are one of those lieutenants. Ages have passed by and during that time you have been has “blessed” with something no other vampire has--wings. Kain, being evil and jealous vampire, punished Raziel for his "transgression". Jealous Kain tore off Raziel’s wings and cast him down into the Lake of the Dead. A millenium has passed while Raziel lay forgotten before he is brought back to existence by The Elder God. He becomes a soul reaver with one purpose and one purpose only--kill Kain.\n<br><br>\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver continues the story from Blood Omen in a very clever and interesting way while also adding many new gameplay features. One of those improvements is the ability to shift between spectral and material plane. Both worlds overlap each other in a way that allows Raziel to overcome obstacles in one world by simply shifting to the other. But beware, because both of those planes are anything but a safe place and something that is harmless on one side can kill you on the other. Soul Reaver is a chapter in a series of masterpieces. With a gripping story, fluent gameplay, and a number so unique features it is clearly one of the most prominent tiles in the gaming history and it is surely worth checking out.\n<br><br><img src="http://items.gog.com/SoulReaver_ratings.png"><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Gothic atmosphere set by stylized visuals and moody music that dynamically changes with the environment.</li><li class="description__features-point">Ability to shift between two overlapping realms (spectral and material) creates unique puzzle-solving possibilities.</li><li class="description__features-point">Fascinating, wide-reaching story about betrayal and vengeance presented in so convincing and believable way that it really makes you thirst for souls of your adversaries.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            LEGACY OF KAIN: SOUL REAVER © 1999 Crystal Dynamics group of companies.

The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies – both mythical and historical. This time around, it’s not the band of brothers that’s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br><h4>STORY</h4>\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	485.79	1969-12-31	BR0	205	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:15.304-03	2023-09-29 19:11:15.373-03

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	485.79	1969-12-31	BR0	205	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:15.452-03	2023-09-29 19:11:15.526-03

Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. \n<br><br>\nEach mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all here.<p></p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then, in 2018, with the developer’s original 486 PC back in action, the author, Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.\n<br><br>\nAs this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind. Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment. Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's systems and much more. \n<br><br>\nWhile the game might look daunting at first, there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions and more. \n<br><br>\nAlso please note that there is no mouse control in this game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.  \n<br><br>\nThis is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s. Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank you!</p><br><b><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></b> is the second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations. Having fought as an Alliance starship commander in Star Fleet I to stem the onslaught of the Krellan and Zaldron Empires, now you get a chance to try command on the "winning" side.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_015.png"><br><i>A Pitched Battle with an Enemy Starbase</i><br><br>\nAs Commander of a Krellan Battlecruiser with four destroyer escorts (forming a "battle fleet"), your mission is to explore the star systems of the United Galactic Alliance looking for planets to conquer and Alliance warships to destroy. Your ships are equipped with the latest technology, including phasers, homing torpedoes and deadly obliterator pods. Also at your command are elite shock troops for boarding and capturing enemy vessels, and legions of Krellan warriors for planetary invasions.\n<br><br><b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> gives you more depth, complexity, and realism than any space war simulation before or since. But that's not all! <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> is actually two games in one. Every time you invade a planet, <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> switches to a complete planetary invasion game that allows you to control the conquering Krellan forces in their attempt to overwhelm the planetary defenders.\n<br><br>\nFrom up to dozens of military targets on the detailed planetary map, select and control up to eight invasion zones from your Invasion Control Screen, or take personal command of your units. Your objectives: to capture cities and factories; knock out shield generators, planetary defense phasers, point defense lasers, and missile launchers; and eliminate both UGA troops and native militia forces. Like combat in space, planetary combat is real-time (no turns, but you can pause!).\n<br><br>\nExplore uncharted star systems and planets - your landing parties may even discover the ruins of ancient civilizations that may contain beneficial alien artifacts. Attack and pillage planets, wipe out civilizations with a single command, interrogate prisoners from a captured starliner, then beam those prisoners into the sun or empty space to improve your crew's morale! Who says command can't be fun?!\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/bp_000_640.png"><br><i>Capturing an Enemy Frigate</i><br><br>\nFeatures of <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> 1.0:\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>35 galactic regions with over 1,700 star systems and 1,000 unique planets to explore and conquer\n<br></li><li>Each planet has its own unique surface, which you can view from orbit\n<br></li><li>Over 10 different types of starships, including: Alliance heavy and light cruisers, destroyers, frigates, scouts, freighters and starliners; Krellan battlecruisers, destroyers, troopships and supply ships\n<br></li><li>Realtime simulation of movement and combat, both space and planetary\n<br></li><li>Ship-to-ship and fleet combat\n<br></li><li>12 critical ship's systems simulated\n<br></li><li>New commands include; communications, intelligence, strategic command, logistics, obliterator pods, science, medical, planetary invasions and more\n<br></li><li>Landing parties to explore planets, contact planetary civilizations, establish bases, obtain supplies and more\n<br></li><li>Legions of elite Krellan warriors for conquering planets, with battle honors persistent through new regions\n<br></li><li>Simulation of crew fatigue and morale, supplies and interactions with captives\n<br></li><li>Multiple mission objectives\n<br></li><li>Assume personal command of planetary invasions and control individual units. \n<br></li><li>Seven ranks with five missions each, each increasing in complexity\n<br></li><li>Sound/music toggle with original PC speaker sound effects</li></ul><h4>About Version 2.0</h4>\n2.0 is a severely updated and enhanced version of the original game, with a wide variety of improvements and additions to the original game!<h4>Improvements in 2.0 (list will grow and change as we approach release)</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Improved AI\n<br></li><li>Improved UI\n<br></li><li>Numerous Bug Fixes\n<br></li><li>Quality of Life Enhancements with Improved Key Commands\n<br></li><li>New Features such as Beaming Prisoners Into Stars, Ship Performance Data and More!\n<br></li><li>New Overlays such as Fleet Command, Probe Operations and More!</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_032.png"><br><i>Krellan Warriors have Landed in One of Eight Invasion Zones of a Technologically-Advanced Planet</i><br><br>\n*1.0 Documents Scanned by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.scribd.com/user/5846146/remow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remowilliams</a>	485.79	1969-12-31	BR0	215	\N	\N	2023-09-29 19:11:15.452-03	2023-09-29 19:11:15.526-03

Each and every descent will lead to new adventures, where	<img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/quotes.png"><br><br>\nBelow the Stone is a punishing pixel art roguelike about dwarves questing to reach the deepest depths. Each and every descent will lead to new adventures, where only the most determined players with many risked lives will be rewarded by the hidden world that lies Below the Stone.<h4><b>Explore a Deep World of Ancient Mysteries</b></h4>Discover the lore of dwarves, the treasures they die for, and the secrets they rarely speak of. Within the stone below lies the adventure everyone seeks, but there's always a price. Often death.<h4><b>Mine and Magically Merge Gems</b></h4>Mine rare gems that grant magical buffs and can be socketed to your weapons and armor. When you have enough of one type of gem merge them together to make a more powerful version! This can be done over and over.<h4><b>The World Below is Not Safe</b></h4>Each level deeper pits you against more cunning creatures and more dangerous biomes. But also greater rewards to mine and uncover. No pain no gain. (And some pain can be relieved with a pint of Dwarven brew.)<h4><b>Roguelike Gameplay</b></h4> With each descent, you'll explore and find many unique ores, gems, and ancient treasures that have been buried before time -- all which will help you delve deeper in future descents...but only if you craft the right gear to survive.<h4><b>Enough Variety Fit for a Dwarven Dinner Feast</b></h4>With over 25 uniquely dangerous and graphically beautiful biomes, there's no lack of new environments and resources to find -- but tread carefully, as each has its own distinct threats as well.<h4><b>Crafting Equipment</b></h4>Prepare each dive below the stone by crafting new equipment, socketing new gems, and brewing new potions with all the resources you've harvested from your previous journeys ... But beware, when you die, anything lost below the stone ... will remain forever buried below the stone.\n<br><br>\nDwarves will be sent below the surface to collect metal and precious gems that your kin request of you. However, you can keep any extra you gain-- make a new pickaxe, a sword, some armor. Whatever increases your odds of coming back on your next trip! Store them safely at the dwarven kingdom, your hub area for crafting, storying items safely for your next expedition, and picking up new missions from your kin. But we warned! If you die Below the Stone, everything you carried on you will be lost under the surface forever.\n<br><br>\nWith each descent you can also decide whether or not you are prepared to go deeper in your journey. Each layer's entrance will be held within a dungeon as a final challenge to see if you are capable and prepared enough to descend further. Once you go down, you will face a bevy of new biomes, creatures, resources, and environments to explore. Each layer is will contain 8-12 unique biomes that will challenge a dwarf's resourcefulness and grit.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/biome.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/biomes_examples.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/kingdom.png"><br><br>\nThe Dwarven kingdom is your place for crafting, preparation, and most importantly storing loot for later expeditions. You have full control over what items you bring with you, what equipment you craft, and what items you choose to keep at home safe and sound. The only catch is if you die, you will lose all the items you took down into the caves on your dwarf - such is the cost of progress!  Additionally, your stay in the dwarven kingdom will yield an ever-growing cast of allies to aid you on your adventures below the surface. For example...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting4.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting1.png"><br>\nA dwarf's best friend is someone who can turn shiny things into useful tools. The Blacksmith is the reliable friend you can return home to when you're in need of proper weaponry, armor, and equipment for your future descents.  His skills will aid in crafting your newly found ores into fresh new equipment to help you on your next trip into the depths, arming yourself for the dangerous realms below...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting5.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting2.png"><br>\nSome characters may be encountered underground and are in need of rescue; these folk will be welcomed to the dwarven kingdom as new companions to help you on your future journeys. You may bump into anything at all, from elven witches who brew potions to legendary dragon-slayers -  and even necromancers! We plan on the kingdom having at least 10 - 12 important mainline characters you will be able to save and bring back to help your future adventures. Each of them will add a unique flavor to the kingdom and your journeys downward as they give you better chances, modifiers, and even change your playstyle.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting6.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting3.png"><br>\nKeeping goblins from scalping that freshly trimmed beard of yours is a top priority for a dwarf - not to mention a mark on their honor to keep their hair intact - so make sure to do anything you can to increase your odds of coming back on your next trip! Brand new armor, weapons, and tools do make your missions easier, but be warned: if you die in Below The Stone, everything remains buried Below The Stone. Forever. So calculate your risks and use your resources wisely, starting with the banker - your trusted ally to make sure your items are safe when you decide not to bring certain equipment! This will let smart and experienced players plan out their future runs well ahead of time, and let you decide if this is the moment you decide to risk it all on and go deeper than you've ever gone before in the name of dwarven progress...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/features_image.png"><br><br><b>Features:</b><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Procedurally generated cave complexes which lead to a new adventure in every descent. \n<br></li><li>Plans on releasing 50+ biomes to explore with unique creatures, fauna, and resources to explore.\n<br></li><li>5 planned layers to explore.\n<br></li><li>Multiple dungeons on each layer to test your mettle.\n<br></li><li>Full character customization (Your equipment determines your stats and abilities).\n<br></li><li>A Dwarven Kingdom with many important characters to meet, save, and aid!\n<br></li><li>Custom Cave missions for every descent.\n<br></li><li>Roguelike experience (If you die, you lose everything you brought with you!)\n<br></li><li>Tough, but Fair!
